- storing metadata 
- capturing/authorizing
- next steps
- getting paid
- managing account
- checklist for going "live"
- questions
- reporting

- **INTEGRATE CHECKOUT**
    - [CHECKOUT TUTORIAL](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/tutorial)
    - enable HTTPS on checkout page
        - [ENABLING HTTPS](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout#does-checkout-require-https)
    - stripe returns token to Checkout or error message. Takes returned token and stores it in pages **PRIMARY FORM** (the         one surrounding the script tag in the checkout-tutorial link)
    - checAkout then submits the form to the server 
    - the **SERVER** uses the posted token to charge the card
        - [CHARGES DOCUMENTATION](https://stripe.com/docs/charges)

- **CREATE CHARGES**
    - [CHARGES DOCUMENTATION](https://stripe.com/docs/charges)
    - happens after you have securely _collected_ and _tokenized_ customers credit card using **CHECKOUT**
    - charge attempts are made from your **SERVER **
        - normally using one of their **CLIENT LIBRARIES**
        [SEE: LIBRARIES](https://stripe.com/docs/libraries)
        - we have `pip install stripe`
        - this will be done on **python** then
    - from there, do a simple **API call** to charge the card (check [here](https://stripe.com/docs/charges) to see python code)
    - you automatically receive money in TWO DAYS(**?**)

- **SAVING CREDIT CARD DETAILS FOR LATER** 
    - STRIPE TOKENS CAN ONLY BE USED **ONCE**
        - stripe provides a `CUSTOMER OBJECT TYPE` that will let us save this info for later use 
        - ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO UPDATE CARD INFO
        [API UPDATE CARD DOCS](https://stripe.com/docs/api#update_card)
            - to CHANGE CARD provide a token as a value for source and update the `CUSTOMER OBJECT`
            https://stripe.com/docs/api#update_customer
            - you can also [DELETE CARD](https://stripe.com/docs/api#delete_card)
- **STORING METADATA**
    - any metadata we choose to include will be viewable in the _Dashboard_ 
    - _example:_ Store's order ID can be attached to the charge used to pay for the order 

- **CAPTURING/AUTHORIZING** 
    - don't completely understand but:
    - to authorize a payment without "capturing" it, make a charge request that also includes the `CAPTURE` parameter with a        value of **FALSE**
        - tells Stripe to only authorize the amount on the customer's card
            - to settle an authorized charge, make a capture charge request
            - [API CAPTURE CHARGE](https://stripe.com/docs/api#capture_charge)
            - the total authorized amount is captured by default and can't capture more than this
- **DYNAMIC STATEMENT DESCRIPTOR** 
    - not _that_ important for right now but I'll get into that later 

- **SOME NEXT STEPS**
    - [getting paid](https://stripe.com/docs/payouts)
    - [managing stripe account](https://stripe.com/docs/dashboard)
    - declines and failed payment
    - disputes overview
    - subscriptions quickstart


- **GETTING PAID**  
    - [PAYOUT DOCUMENTATION](https://stripe.com/docs/payouts)
    - your bank account info is required when activating your account
        - can update these details at any time at [payout settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/payouts)
        - make a payout schedule on dashboard 
        - look into payout failures 

- **MANAGING STRIPE ACCOUNT**
    - [STRIPE DOCS DASHBOARD](https://stripe.com/docs/dashboard)
        - managing multiple accounts
            - might be good for multiple requests and stuff, give LSES people access to main account and can make requests via multiple accounts 
            - can make additional [Stripe accounts](https://support.stripe.com/questions/stripe-account-for-multiple-projects) at any time, each of which operates independently from one another



- **GOING LIVE CHECKLIST!!**
    - steps to take
        - one related to the Stripe account
            - [STRIPE ACCT CHECKLIST](https://stripe.com/docs/checklist#account)
        - one related to the Stripe integration
            - [STRIPE INTEGRATION CHECKLIST](https://stripe.com/docs/checklist#integration)
    - literally just look through [here](https://stripe.com/docs/checklist)

- **QUESTIONS** 
    - what is [webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks)
        - do we need it? 

- **REPORTING**
    -[REPORTING DOCUMENTATION](https://stripe.com/docs/reporting)


- **APPLYING FILTERS**
> "The balance history and account activity can be filtered to display results within a specified criteria. Use the Filter option, located at the top-left of the results, to view and apply the available filter options. Account activity with filtered results can also be exported to a CSV file, reducing the amount of data you need to work with."
